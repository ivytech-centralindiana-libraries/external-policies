Each student will receive $5 of "free" printing per semester. The funds will be subtracted from your student account via your computer login. It is very important to logout so someone else will not use your account to print. Printing above the $5 quota will need to be paid by the student. Students can add funds to their account at the Bursar’s Office or by credit card on Campus Connect under the “pay for printing” tab in Student Links.

* Black / White printing: $.05 per page
* Color Printing: $.30 per page.
The library is unable to give refunds for printing. Printing refunds must be handled at the Bursar office. No refunds or credits for bad prints, except in cases of printer failure. If the issue was due to an equipment or system error, you may be eligible for a reprint.

Double sided duplex black & white printing, when available, is $.07 per page. Double sided color printing available with assistance, see library staff.
