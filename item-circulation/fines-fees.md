Items will still check out for 2 weeks.
Once overdue, 2 weeks of grace will occur with no fines.
Week 3-4 overdue will result in a flat $3 fine
Week 5+ the item will be declared lost. 
If any item is lost or heavily damaged, the fine will be the replacement cost of the item plus a $5.00 handling fee.
Once a lost item has been paid for, there are no refunds.

If the lost item is returned before the replacement copy is ordered, the cost of book is removed from the student record by staff leaving just the processing fee. That results in a flat $5 fee for each lost item.

Textbooks: Overdue reserve textbook fines are $.05 per item per minute for the first 24 hours. Read the [textbook policy](http://libguides.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=399021&p=27195050) for more information.

PLEASE NOTE: If you fail to pay your fines and/or fees, your borrowing privileges will be suspended and you will not be able to register for classes, graduate or get a copy of your transcript until your account is paid-in-full.

We are not able to accept credit or debit cards. Cash only.
