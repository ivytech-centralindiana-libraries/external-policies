The library maintains many textbooks on reserve for short-term use by currently enrolled students. Please check with a librarian to see if we have one for your class. Every attempt is made to have as many textbooks available as possible each semester for our face to face classes; however, for various reasons, we may not be able to acquire certain titles.
