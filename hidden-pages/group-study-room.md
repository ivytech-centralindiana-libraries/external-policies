### Purpose

The study rooms of the library are for use as a site for quiet study by small groups.  Such use shall at all times be consistent with the fundamental objectives of the library to provide a suitable environment for academic activities.

#### Check Out

* The study rooms are checked out on a first come first serve basis.  No reservations may be made. 
* All people in the group are considered one "check out."
* One time renewals for groups are allowed if the other study room is vacant.  

#### Time Limits

* The room is checked out for a four hour period. The key must be returned to the circulation desk at the end of that time to avoid late fees of .05 cents per minute.
* If you have checked out the room and you leave for more than 15 minutes, the room is no longer checked out to you, and the room will be open for checkout.
* Items left unattended for more than 15 minutes will be removed by the library staff.
* Patrons must vacate the room 15 minutes before closing.

#### Users

* At least one member of the group must be currently enrolled as an Ivy Tech student and must check out with their Student ID.
* Individual users may be bumped for a group checkout.

#### Guidelines

* Patrons may be asked to leave if they disturb others or engage in destructive or inappropriate behavior. 
* The study room key cannot leave the library. If you leave the room unattended, you must leave the key at the front desk with library staff.
* Users of the study rooms are responsible for leaving the rooms in a neat and orderly condition.  Turn off the lights, shut the door, throw out trash, and return the door hanger and key to the library staff.          

#### Accountability / Non-Compliance

* The library is not responsible for any of your personal items should you leave them in the room unattended (to go to the restroom for instance).
* If a room is not clean, please notify the library staff.
* When a study room is checked out in your name, you will be accountable for all policy infringements.

#### Food & Drink

* No food is allowed near the computers. Drinks with screw-top lids and prepackaged snacks only (no pizza, sandwiches, fast food, etc.) are allowed at the tables.
* Food and drink use in the study rooms follows the same guidelines as the Food and Drink Policy for the library.
