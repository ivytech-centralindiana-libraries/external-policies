The purpose of this document is to address rules and conduct expectations for community computer users in the Central Indiana Ivy Tech libraries and other computers on campus. Access to and use of college computer resources is an educational opportunity which is a privilege, not a right extended by Ivy Tech Community College to community patrons.
Community users are to conduct themselves with the same expected behavior as any student. i.e., "in a mature, dignified, and honorable manner" according to the [The Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities](http://www.ivytech.edu/files/CodeOfStudentRights-Responsibilities2015.pdf) outlines the expectations for student conduct.  Any activity that violates local, state or federal law or ignores common standards of honesty, privacy and decency is also a violation of this policy. Students are bound by this college policy and it is the expectation that other users will also abide by it.

Members of the public are entitled to use computers as long as they have a valid JITA Library Guest ID and abide by all computing and network policies of Ivy Tech Library and Ivy Tech Community College (page 11 of [Code of Conduct](http://www.ivytech.edu/files/CodeOfStudentRights-Responsibilities2015.pdf)). Community users 15 years old or older may obtain a JITA pass by presenting a government issued picture ID. This pass is valid for 24 hours and contains an Ivy Tech Library ID and passphrase which is nontransferable.

Computing resources may not be used for any purpose which is illegal, immoral, unethical, academically dishonest as in plagiarizing or cheating, damaging to the reputation of the college, inconsistent with the mission of the college, or likely to subject the college to liability as determined solely by the college.

Because campus computers are publicly accessible, the college will not guarantee a right to privacy when they are used. The college may monitor and access information for investigative and/or administrative purposes and may take administrative action in response to any violation or this policy, applicable administrative regulation, or other law. 

The Library reserves the right to impose time limits on computer use, to restrict use of computers with special software or database access, and to give preference to Ivy Tech students, faculty and staff.  Because the primary purpose of the library is to serve students, availability of computers for community users will be subject to student demand and use. When 80% of the computers are in use, the library staff will ask all users NOT doing academic work to log off so that students may have first priority. The library staff reserves the right to restrict community users' usage during peak student usage times, such as certain hours of the day or times in the semester such as finals week.
