#### Are there any charges for using ILL?
No. We request items from libraries that lend materials free of charge.

#### Can I renew my ILL items?
If the book is not currently overdue interlibrary loan staff will place a renewal request with the lending library. Interlibrary loan staff will notify patron with a new due date.

#### Are there overdue ILL fines?
Overdue fines and lost items fines will be calculated by the library and will follow the same policy for non-ILL checkouts.
