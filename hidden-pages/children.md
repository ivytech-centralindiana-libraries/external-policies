### Children under the age of 15:

Per college policy - "To ensure a positive environment for all students on campus, children are not allowed in instructional areas.  Instructional areas include classrooms, labs, and other areas set aside for academic learning purposes."

* Children at least 15 years of age may use the Ivy Tech Libraries unsupervised.  A picture ID with proof of age or valid Ivy Tech library card is required at all times.  Like all patrons, children are expected to follow the library’s stated policies regarding appropriate behavior while in the library.
* If a child’s behavior is disruptive or violates the library’s stated policies, the child will be asked to leave the library.  If the child does not comply, Campus Security will be contacted.
* Library computers are first and foremost for academic use by Ivy Tech students. Individual log-ins required; children under 15 may not use a computer. Children at least 15 years old can use the library computers per [Computer Use Policy](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=399021&p=2718243).
* The Library does not censor library materials.  The Library staff is not responsible for supervision or restriction of a child’s access to library materials.
* Children at least 15 years old can obtain a library card.  Please see the Children as Community Users section of this policy for details.

#### Children as Community Users

Community Users are Indiana citizens who are not currently registered as Ivy Tech students.  Children at least 15 years old can obtain a community user card when accompanied by a parent or adult guardian.  For a full explanation of the requirements and benefits of this program, please see the library’s Library Resources and Services for Community Users brochure.

To obtain a community user card for a child, the parent must present:

1.  A valid picture ID from the following list:
  * State issued ID card
  * State issued drivers license
  * School ID card for the child
2.  One of the following:
  * A piece of mail with the parent’s name and address on it (example: current utility bill).
  * The child’s school schedule with name, address, and date
  * The child’s report card with name, address, and date

The parent or adult guardian must sign for a dependent under the age of 18.  The parent or adult guardian assumes responsibility for the return of all library materials, paying fines, paying for damage to or loss of materials, and notifying the library of any change in name or address.

Reminder: ALL community patrons must present an Ivy Tech library card in order to check out library materials.
